  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'What are the best travel destinations in Europe?'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())

  console.log('Tara says:', data.response);
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Tara says:', data.response); // Will politely decline
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### Frontend JavaScript Example (Chat with Travel History)
```javascript
const conversationHistory = [
  { role: 'user', content: 'What are good hotels in Tokyo?' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Tokyo has excellent hotels! For luxury, consider the Park Hyatt Tokyo or the Mandarin Oriental. For mid-range, the Tokyu Stay hotels are great value. What\'s your budget range?' }
];

  console.log('Tara info:', data.assistant);
  console.log('Specialization:', data.assistant.specialization);
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Rate Limiting and Best Practices

- **Message Length**: Keep messages under 1000 characters
- **Travel Focus**: Only ask travel-related questions
- **Conversation History**: Limit history to recent travel conversations
- **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors in your frontend code
- **User Experience**: Show loading states while waiting for responses

## Security Considerations

- The API key is stored securely on the backend
- Input validation prevents malicious requests
- Message length limits prevent abuse
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"AI service authentication failed"**
   - Check if the API key is valid and active

2. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Wait a moment before sending another request

3. **"Request timeout"**
   - The AI service is taking too long to respond
   - Try again in a few seconds

4. **"Message is too long"**
   - Shorten your message to under 1000 characters

5. **Tara declines non-travel questions**
   - This is expected behavior - Tara only answers travel-related questions
   - Rephrase your question to be travel-focused

6. **"Invalid conversation history format"**
   - Ensure conversation history follows the correct format with `role` and `content` fields
